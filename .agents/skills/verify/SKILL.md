Run the verification suite and report the result. Do not change code; if something fails, report
the failing test(s) and the likely cause.

## Steps

1. Ensure dev dependencies are installed (only if `pytest` is missing):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Run the tests (`conftest.py` sets dummy Supabase creds, suppresses SMTP and clears the
   QStash signing keys — no network, no signature required):
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```

3. Syntax check:
   ```bash
   python -m compileall -q gradebook_mailer app.py
   ```

## Report

- Tests: passed / failed (with names and the first failing assertion).
- Compile: OK / errors.
- If everything is green, say so explicitly.
